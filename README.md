# Marlin-Internet

The page for Marlin Internet demonstrates the proper use of tables to convey information clearly and precisely.  The table communicates information about this ISP's internet service plans with varying prices, speeds, cloud storage and more.

The table uses colgroups to style the first column differently from the other four columns.  The table is grouped into a header, a footer and a body section to make CSS styling easy.

The background of the entire table element uses a radial gradient.

There are two table header rows at the top and each is styled differently with text color and background color by using psuedo class selectors :first-of-type and :not(:first-of-type)
